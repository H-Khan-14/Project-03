The project was really fun and enjoyable. It was however not without it's difficulties. I had trouble with the JavaScript syntax and grammar as well as conceptualizing what class connects with what page and what parameters or variables I had to add. Aside from that I had some issus debugging because whenever one thing was off it caused a cascading effect who's source I had trouble locating.
